What is a Queue?

A queue is a linear data structure where elements are stored in the FIFO 
(First In First Out) principle where the first element inserted would be the first 
element to be accessed. A queue is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) similar to stack, 
the thing that makes queue different from stack is that a queue is open at both its
 ends. The data is inserted into the queue through one end and deleted from it using
  the other end. Queue is very frequently used in most programming languages.
