What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure where elements are stored in the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle where the last 
element inserted would be the first element to be deleted. A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), that is popularly used
in most programming languages. It is named stack because it has the similar operations as the real-world stacks, for
example − a pack of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

Stack is considered a complex data structure because it uses other data structures for implementation, such as Arrays,
Linked lists, etc.
